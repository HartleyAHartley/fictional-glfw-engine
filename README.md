# Madd Engine

Madd is a 3D-Game Engine built with opengl and glfw3.

Madd is being built to isolate opengl/glfw3 calls to the lowest level classes.

That way to switch the engine to a different graphics libraries only the low level classes will have to be rewritten.

# How to Build
Madd is currently built with Cmake.

Tested Generators:

	Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64: Builds Successfully

	MinGW/Unix Makefiles: Builds Successfully
